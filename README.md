## In This Example, we are going to create a web application that contain three pages:

#### Home page 
#### Our Services
#### Contact us

Each page contain a nav bar link (Home, Our Services, Contact us),
The web application is only available in working time (Monday to Friday,  from 9 to 17),
we use Express to create the server and handle routes
we create a custom  middleware to verify the time of the request
